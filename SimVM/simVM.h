//
// A virtual memory simulation.
//
// Virtual memory is a sequence of 32-bit words.
//
// Physical memory is a shorter sequence of 32-bit words.
//
// Virtual memory addresses are 32 bits.
//
// Virtual and physical memory is managed in fixed-size pages.
//
// A page table, which is logically in physical memory, maps virtual
// memory addresses to physical memory addresses. Since physical
// memory is smaller than virtual memory, the page table might indicate
// that a particular page is not currently present in physical memory,
// and that it is logically stored on disk.
//
// However this is a simulation, so all memory words are actually stored
// in the memory of this program, and disk is not used. Similarly the page
// table does not actually exist in the simulated physical memory, but
// rather exists only in the data structures of the simulation.
//
// A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is simulated. The TLB stores
// recent virtual-to-physical address translations.
//
// The following properties of the virtual memory are set when it is
// created:
//   1. size of the virtual memory in pages
//   2. size of the physical memory in pages
//   3. size of a page in words
//   4. number of TLB entries
//   5. page replacement algorithm
//   6. TLB replacement algorithm
//
// The size of the virtual memory must be larger than the size of the
// physical memory.
//
// The size of a page must be a power of two.
//
// The size of the virtual memory times the size of a page must be less
// than or equal to 2^32.
//
// The size of the TLB should be less than or equal to the size of physical
// memory.
//
// The replacement algorithms are either 0 for round-robin replacement or
// 1 for LRU replacement.
//
// A virtual memory system is initialized to have the first K pages
// of virtual memory loaded into physical memory, where K is the
// number of pages in the physical memory. Initially the virtual
// memory system contains arbitrary values (i.e. not necessarily
// zeros).
//
// The TLB is initialized to have the VM to PM mapping for the
// first N pages loaded into physical pages (i.e. starting at physical
// page 0), where N is the number of TLB entries.
//
// The goal of the simulation is to report the number of page misses,
// the number of TLB misses, and the number of disk writes.
